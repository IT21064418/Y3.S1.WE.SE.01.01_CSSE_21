## About the LankaHerbals

Lanka Herbals is an Online e-commerce platform that we created where individual sellers can sell their herbal products for customers via a online platform. We used the Microservices software architecture for this project.There are 8 backend microservices,
+ Authentication Service - This service provides authentication for buyers, sellers, and admin. It will also provide an API for user registration and login.
+ Cart Service - This service provides an API for buyers to add and remove items from the shopping cart.
+ delivery Service - This service provides an API for buyers to select delivery oprions, and for a third-party delivery service to process the request.
+ Item Management Service - This service provides an API for sellers to add and update items.It will also provide an API for admin to delete items.
+ Order Management Service - This service provide an API for buyers to place orders and for admin to confirm orders. It will also provide an Api for tracking the status of orders.
+ Payment Service - This service provides an API for buyers to make payments using credit cards or payment intergration services.
+ Ratings and Reviews Service - This service will provide an API for buyers to select delivery options, and for a third party delivery service to process the request.
+ User Profile Service - This service provides an API for users to update their profiles, including their personal information, address, phone number, etc.

Addditionaly We developed a Gateway service to separate the external public APIs from internal microservice APIs, allowing for microservices to be added and boundaries changed.
