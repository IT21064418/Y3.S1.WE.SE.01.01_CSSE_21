## About the LankaHerbals

Lanka Herbals is an Online e-commerce platform that we created where individual sellers can sell their herbal products for customers via a online platform. We used the Microservices software architecture for this project.There are 8 backend microservices,
+ Authentication Service
+ Cart Service
+ delivery Service
+ Item Management Service
+ Order Management Service
+ Payment Service
+ Ratings and Reviews Service
+ User Profile Service

Addditionaly We developed a Gateway service to separate the external public APIs from internal microservice APIs, allowing for microservices to be added and boundaries changed.

### Build

Instructions to build all the apps and packages will be on:
